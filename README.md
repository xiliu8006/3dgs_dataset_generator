This repository contains the official authors implementation associated with the paper "3DGS-Enhancer: Enhancing Unbounded 3D GaussianSplatting with View-consistent 2D Diffusion Priors". We provide this repo to build the paired dataset. Our dataset is based on the [DL3DV-10K](https://dl3dv-10k.github.io/DL3DV-10K/) DATASET and this codebase is based on [3D Gaussian splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). Thanks for their great work!

If you think this code base is helpful for your paper, please cite these three papers.

# we provide the shell to generate dataset, plesae modify the shell based on your own servers environment.
``shell
bash train_multi_nodes.sh
``
